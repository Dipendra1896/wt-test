# Assignment-5:
Develop a simple calculator using HTML, CSS and DOM in JS  
  
# OBJECTIVE:
To develop a simple calculator using HTML, CSS and DOM in JS  
  
# THEORY:
Document Object Model(DOM)in JS:-  
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.  

A web page is a document that can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. In both cases, it is the same document but the Document Object Model (DOM) representation allows it to be manipulated. As an object-oriented representation of the web page, it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.  

For example, the DOM specifies that the querySelectorAll method in this code snippet must return a list of all the <p> elements in the document:   


# CONCLUSION:
We developed a simple calculator using HTML, CSS and DOM in JS.
