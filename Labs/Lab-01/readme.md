OBJECT:ELEMENT OF HTML
THEORY:
Nested order and unorder list: we have to use an ul or ol tag to describe th order of the list,we use the ul tag ;while for creating an ordered list we use,<code <ol>/code> tag.
Semantics tag for layout:
Semantics HTML refers to syntax that makes the HTNL more comprehensible by better deefining the different sections and layout of web pages.It makes webpages more informative and adaptable,allowing browers and search engines to better interpret content.Some of symantics tag are:header footer ,main,section,nav,span etc.

Text formation tag:
What is the use of formating tag in html? The formating can be used to set the text styles(like-bold.italic,underlined or emphasized etc.)highlighting the text, making text suoerscript and subscript,different formatting tags in HTMl are "b","strong" etc.Both tags are used to make the text bold.
