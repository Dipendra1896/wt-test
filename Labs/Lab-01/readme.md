# OBJECT: ELEMENT OF HTML

## Nested order and and order list
We have to use an <code>ul</code>or <code>ol</code> tag to describe the order of the list. For creating an unordered list, we usre the <code>ul</code>tag,while for creating an ordered list
we use,<code< ol>/code> tag.<br>
After that <code>li</code>is used to list the items

## Semantics tag for layout
Semantic HTML refers to syntax that makes the HTML more comprehensible by better defining the 
different sections and layout of web pages. It makes web pages more informative and adaptable, 
allowing browsers and search engines to better interpret content.
Some of symantics tag are:
<code>header </code><code>footer </code><code>nav </code><code>span </code>

## Text formation tax
What is the use of formatting tag in HTML?
The formatting can be used to set the text styles (like â€“ bold, italic, or emphasized, etc.),
highlighting the text, making text superscript and subscript,
different formatting tags in HTML are <code> b </code>and<code> strong</code>  etc.
Both tags are used to make the text bold.

## Image audio video
To embed audio in HTML, we use the <code>audio</code> tag.To embed video in HTML, we use the <code>video</code>
tag.To embed image in HTML, we use the <code>img</code> tag. 

## iframe
<code>iframe</code> tag is used to put any link on the webside.
# Codes:

# Conclusion:
In this way we can make format our text, manage the margin and put image, audio, video and link in the website.

# OBJECTIVE: FLOW LAYOUT AND POSITIONED LAYOUT IN CSS
# THEORY:
## Flow layout : 
Normal Flow, or Flow Layout, is the way that Block and Inline elements are displayed on a page before any changes are made to their layout. In normal flow, inline elements display in the inline direction, that is in the direction words are displayed in a sentence according to the Writing Mode of the document. Block elements display one after the other, as paragraphs do in the Writing Mode of that document.

## Positioned Layout:
A positioned element is an element whose computed <code>position</code> value is either <code>relative</code>, <code>absolute</code>, <code>normal</code>, or <code>sticky</code>. (In other words, it's anything except static.)
A relatively positioned element is an element whose computed <code>position</code> value is <code>relative</code>. The <code>top</code> and <code>bottom</code> properties specify the vertical offset from its normal position; the <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> properties specify the horizontal offset.
An absolutely positioned element is an element whose computed position value is <code>absolute</code> or <code.fixed</code>. The <code>left</code><code>right</code><code>top</code> <code>bottom</code>  properties specify offsets from the edges of the element's containing block. (The containing block is the ancestor relative to which the element is positioned.) If the element has margins, they are added to the offset. The element establishes a new block formatting context (BFC) for its contents.
A stickily positioned element is an element whose computed <code>position</code> value is<code> sticky</code>. It's treated as relatively positioned until its containing block crosses a specified threshold (such as setting <code>top</code> to value other than auto) within its flow root (or the container it scrolls within), at which point it is treated as "stuck" until meeting the opposite edge of its containing block.

# CODES:

# CONCLUSION:
In this way we can manage the layout in webpage.
