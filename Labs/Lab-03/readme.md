program no.1:
OBJECT: WAP TO REVERSE THE STRING PROVIDED BY THE USERS.
THEORY:
      When the user enters a string in the input field and clicks the "Reverse" button, the JavaScript function reverseString() is called. This function gets the value of the input field, reverses the string using the split(), reverse(), and join() methods, and then displays the reversed string in the output element.
CONCLUSION:
       hence,we learn how to reverse string using javascript.


PROGRAM NO:02
THOERY:
       When the user enters a number in the input field and clicks the "Check" button, the JavaScript function checkPalindrome() is called. This function gets the value of the input field, converts it to a string, reverses the string using the split(), reverse(), and join() methods, and then checks if the original number string is equal to the reversed number string. If it is, it displays the message that the number is a palindrome, otherwise it shows the message that it's not a palindrome. 
CONCLUSION:
    hence,we learn how to check palindrome number using javascript.



    PROGRAM NO.03
    THEORY:
            When the user clicks the "Find Sum" button, the JavaScript function findSum() is called. This function declares a variable sum to keep track of the sum of prime numbers. It then uses a nested loop to check each number between 1 and 50 if it's prime or not. If a number is prime, it adds the number to the sum variable. Finally, the sum of prime number is displayed on the webpage.Note: The above solution finds the sum of prime numbers between 2 and 50, since 1 is not a prime number. 
CONCLUSION:
        hence learn how to find sum of prime number using javascript.



PROGRAM NO:04
THEORY:
      When the user clicks the "Reverse" button, the JavaScript function reverseArray() is called. This function calls the reverse() method on the array, which reverses the order of the elements in the array. The reversed array is then displayed on the webpage.
 CONCLUSION:
            hence we learn hoe to reverse the array using javascript.



PROGRAM NO:05
THEORY:
      In this example, when the user selects the sort order and clicks the "Sort" button, the JavaScript function sortArray() is called. This function gets the sort order selected by the user and based on that uses the sort() method on the array and sorts the array in either ascending or descending order. The sorted array is then displayed on the webpag.
CONCLUSION:
          hence,we learn how to sort arrays using javascript.
